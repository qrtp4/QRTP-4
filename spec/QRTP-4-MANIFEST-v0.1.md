# QRTP-4 Manifest v0.1

**QRTP-4 is a passport-layer protocol for digital and physical authenticity.**

---

## Core Laws

1. **Identity comes before value.**
2. Every asset must have a **Passport ID**.
3. Trust is proven by **cryptographic signature**, not design.
4. Verification must be **public, simple, and fast**.
5. A passport can be **issued, suspended, or revoked**.
6. Copying a QR is possible — **counterfeiting trust is not**.
7. The registry is the **source of truth**.
8. The issuer is accountable through **public keys**.
9. The QRTP-4 Mark (4 squares + Core) is the **seal of recognition**.
10. **No Passport = No Trust.**

---

## Mission

To build a global standard where authenticity is verifiable by anyone, anywhere.
