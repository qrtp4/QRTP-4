# QRTP-4 Roadmap (v0.1 -> v1.0)

## Phase 1 - Genesis MVP (v0.1)

- [x] Protocol Spec (passport, signature, registry)
- [x] Visual Mark Spec (4 squares + core)
- [x] Issuer + Verifier (Issue -> Verify -> Revoke)
- [x] GitHub Pages live verifier

**Goal:** prove the concept works end-to-end.

---

## Phase 2 - Armor Layer (v0.2)

- [ ] Scan event logging (scan count + time window)
- [ ] Risk scoring (suspicious activity detection)
- [ ] Basic anti-fraud rules (rate limits, replay patterns)
- [ ] Passport lifecycle upgrades (suspend / reinstate policies)

**Goal:** stop silent QR copying and detect abuse.

---

## Phase 3 - Registry API & Multi-Issuer System (v0.3)

- [ ] Public Registry API (status lookup)
- [ ] Multi-issuer support (issuer onboarding)
- [ ] Issuer identity proofs (public key governance)
- [ ] Signed registry snapshots (tamper-evident history)

**Goal:** make QRTP-4 scalable beyond a single issuer.

---

## Phase 4 - Real-World Use Cases (v0.5)

- [ ] Wallet passports (donations, trusted addresses)
- [ ] Product authenticity (anti-counterfeit labels)
- [ ] Ticket passports (anti-scalper + one-time entry)
- [ ] Document passports (certificates, proofs, records)

**Goal:** deploy QRTP-4 into real verification scenarios.

---

## Phase 5 - QRTP-4 Standard v1.0 (Public Release)

- [ ] Stable spec (backward compatible)
- [ ] Reference implementation (issuer + verifier SDK)
- [ ] Compliance levels (MARK-L1/L2/L3 enforcement)
- [ ] Public documentation + adoption kit

**Goal:** establish QRTP-4 as a global passport-layer standard.
